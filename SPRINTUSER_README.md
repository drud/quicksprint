* Windows 7 or higher, MacOS El Capitan or higher or a recent/stable Linux distribution.
* A robust code editor such as Visual Studio Code, Atom, PhpStorm or Netbeans (this may be provided as part of this package).

**⚠️ You can still install and contribute to Drupal even without these requirements using [Drupal's quick-start command](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/install/quick-start-launch-a-local-demo-version-of-drupal-8-using-4-brief-steps)**!

### 3. Install Docker and Other Requirements

#### 3.1 Docker CE or Docker Toolbox

Find the Docker installer for your Operating System underneath the **installs** directory. It is important to install the version of Docker provided for compatibility with the tools.

 Operating System | Docker Version | Installer
 ---------------- | -------------- | -----------------
 Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise (HyperV enabled) | Docker CE | "Docker for Windows Installer.exe"
 Windows 10 Home | Docker Toolbox | DockerToolbox-VERSION-ce.exe
 Windows 7 (or no HyperV enabled)| Docker Toolbox | DockerToolbox-VERSION-ce.exe
 MacOS | Docker CE | Docker.dmg
 Linux | Docker CE, docker-compose | See [Linux instructions](https://docs.docker.com/install/#docker-ce)

**⚠️ Docker Toolbox users**: Please install "Git for Windows" and "VirtualBox" as needed during the install process.

**⚠️ Docker CE only** Start Docker

**⚠️ Docker CE only** Open Docker preferences and set docker memory allocation to 3.0GB or greater in the Advanced section. This is required to start containers.

#### 3.2 ddev

**⚠️ Windows users**: Find the ddev installer underneath the **ddev_installs** directory.

#### 3.3 Git

**⚠️ Windows users**:  Git Bash is used for all installation scripts, and of course you'll need git to be able to develop patches. [Helpful guide to git for Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/documentation/git). Find the Git-2.18.0-64-bit.exe installer underneath the **installs** directory.

### 4. Open Terminal

Open your Terminal application:

Operating System | Docker Version | Program
---------------- | -------------- | ----------------
Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise (HyperV enabled) | Docker CE | Git Bash
Windows 10 Home | Docker Toolbox | Docker Quickstart Terminal
Windows 7 (no HyperV support) | Docker Toolbox | Docker Quickstart Terminal
MacOS | Docker CE | Terminal.app or your preferred terminal application
Linux | Docker CE | Your preferred terminal application

### 5. Install Contribution Tools

1. Change directory to the drupal_sprint_package directory using the `cd` command:
   * Example: Run `cd ~/Desktop/drupal_sprint_package`
2. Run the `install_ddev.sh` command and follow the prompts.
   * Example: `./install_ddev.sh`
3. Follow the instructions that print out at the end of the previous command to create a "sprint instance".
   * Example: `cd ~/sprint` and `./start_sprint.sh`.
4. Follow the instructions that print out at the end of the `./start_sprint.sh` command:
   1. Change directory into the newly created directory named `sprint-YYYYMMDD-HHMM` (with today's date and the time you ran `start_sprint`).
   2. Run `./start_clean.sh` to start your Drupal environment!

This may take a few minutes and will provide you with a set of URLs and further instructions for using your contribution environment.
