If you need to switch Drupal branches, for example to 9.0.x, you can
use the utility switch_branch.sh. Although the script stashes changes to
avoid losing your changes, you're best to save them away yourself first.
switch_branch.sh also drops your existing database, so after running it
you'll need to do a manual web-based install.

Examples:
./switch_branch.sh 9.0.x
./switch_branch.sh 8.8.x
