# Quicksprint

Quicksprint is a basic toolkit to get people started with ddev and a Drupal or TYPO3 codebase. This is intended for code sprints where lots of people need to get started with the same environment in a short period of time.

Maintainers create a download package for sprint users. Sprint users just have to use that package, they don't have to understand anything about how it's created.

* Read the [Drupal Sprintuser README](framework/drupal/SPRINTUSER_README.md) if you're a Drupal user using the pre-built package.
* Read the [Drupal Maintainer README](framework/drupal/MAINTAINER_README.md) if you're building or maintaining the package. This is a very small number of people, as the package is normally built by an automated system on CircleCI.
