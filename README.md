# Quicksprint

Quicksprint is a basic toolkit to get people started with ddev and a Drupal codebase. This is intended for code sprints where lots of people need to get started with the same environment in a short period of time.

Maintainers create a download package for sprint users. Maintainers should read the [MAINTAINER_README](MAINTAINER_README.md). Users of the download package should read the [SPRINTUSER_README](SPRINTUSER_README.md).
